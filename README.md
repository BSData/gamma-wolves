## Overview ##

BSData organisation created this project. It's a GitHub repository of datafiles.
Maintained by community, in no way endorsed by BattleScribe or any other company/publisher. If you want to help develop - cool! We need you! Take a look at [our homepage][BSData.net]

These datafiles will contain all the profile information publicly available for Ash Barker's Gamma Wolves tabletop miniatures skirmish game, published by [Osprey][].
As of the initial commit, rules text is missing. This will be added over time, but the core list-building experience should already be sufficient for most players.
